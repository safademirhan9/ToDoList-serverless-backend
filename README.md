# Backend Codebase for ToDoList

Welcome to the backend code repository for ToDoList. This repository contains the serverless backend code responsible for powering the backend services of our project. Our backend is built on the AWS cloud infrastructure, utilizing AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB for serverless computing, API management, and data storage, respectively.

## Technologies and Services Used

- **AWS Lambda:** Our backend logic is implemented as serverless functions using AWS Lambda. Lambda allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers, ensuring cost-efficiency and scalability.

- **AWS API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway is responsible for routing and managing HTTP requests to our Lambda functions. It serves as the entry point to our backend API.

- **Amazon DynamoDB:** DynamoDB is our NoSQL database of choice, providing scalable and high-performance storage for our application's data.

- **Serverless Framework:** We manage and deploy our serverless infrastructure using the Serverless Framework, which simplifies the development and deployment process.
